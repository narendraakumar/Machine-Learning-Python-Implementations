# Machine-Learning---Python-Implementations

Basic ML algorithms written from scratch in python using numpy.  
Some of the algorithms are just Python versions of the Octave code from Andrew Ng's Course.

Algorithms To Do:
- ~~Linear regression~~
- ~~Logistic regression~~
- ~~SVM~~
- ~~K - Nearest Neighbors[Classification]~~
- ~~Neural networks~~
- Naive Bayes
- Trees/Forests
