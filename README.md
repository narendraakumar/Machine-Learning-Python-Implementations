# Machine-Learning---Python-Implementations
Basic ML algorithms written from scratch in python using numpy.  
Most of the code is just Python version of the Octave code from Andrew Ng's Course.

Algorithms To Do:
- ~~Linear regression~~
- ~~Logistic regression~~
- SVM
- K - means
- ~~Neural networks~~
